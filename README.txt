The main script is mazeTester.py.
There are four sample configuration files, one for each task.  These specify the parameters used to run assignment 2.

To run the script, go to the same folder/directory that this README.txt file is located, and execute:

On Windows:
    python mazeTester2.py sampleConfig01TaskA.json
On *nix, particularly core teaching servers:
    python3 mazeTester2.py sampleConfig01TaskA.json

On the core teaching servers, matplotlib isn't installed, hence visualisation won't work.  Please run the visualisation on your own machines.

Please avoid modifying the provided files, apart from implementing adjListGraph.py and adjMatGraph.py.
If you must modify anything, please check in with the teaching team first.
